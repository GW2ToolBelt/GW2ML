### 3.0.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Improvements

- Migrated from JNI to Java's new FFI.
  - This removes the need to have a separate native artifact alongside the library.
  - Introduced new method overloads that accept `MemorySegment` instead of `ByteBuffer`.
  - Deprecated the `ByteBuffer` methods for removal.
- Migrated from JSR305 annotations to [JSpecify](https://jspecify.dev/).

#### Breaking Changes

- `MumbleLink#viewOf(ByteBuffer)` now requires a direct buffer.
- Removed (public) dependency on `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305`.
- Removed the deprecated `MountType#valueOf(long)` overload.
- The deprecated public constructor of `MumbleLink.Context` has been hidden.
- The minimum required Java version is now 22.
