### 1.4.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Improvements

- Added support for specifying file handle explicitly when opening a view via
  `MumbleLink#open(String)`.
    - This is meant to be used with the `-mumble <name>` command line argument
      that was added to Guild Wars 2 on 28. April 2020 to better support
      multiple game clients on a single PC.
- Added `UIState#isInCombat` bit check.
- Added `MumbleLink.Context#getProcessID` which returns the ID of the game
  process that has most recently updated the data.
