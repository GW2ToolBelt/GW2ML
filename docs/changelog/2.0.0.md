### 2.0.0

_Released 2020 Sep 03_

#### Overview

With `2.0.0` comes a major maintenance release that removes previously
deprecated functionality and - most importantly - migrates to the `gw2tb.com`
domain to bring GW2ML in line with upcoming libraries.

#### Breaking Changes

- Switched from the "gw2toolbelt.github.com" URL to "gw2tb.com". (This affects
  all package names, module names and imports.) 
- Removed the mislabeled `UIState#isInLoadingScreen`.
